# SVM Kernel Comparison

## Overview
This project compares SVM kernels (Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid) for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant/benign.

## How to Use
1. **Download .ipynb and open in any notebook editor (Google Collab/Jupyter Notebook)**:  

2. **Run the notebook**:  
   - Click "Runtime" → "Run all" to execute all cells.  
   - Results (accuracy, plots) will appear inline.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`  
- *No local setup needed—runs entirely in Colab!*

## Results
- Best performing kernel: **RBF (98.25% accuracy)**  
- Detailed analysis in [SVM_Kernel_Comparison.pdf](SVM_Kernel_Comparison.pdf).
